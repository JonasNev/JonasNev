- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JonasNev

I am a Veterinary medicine Major, i am studying back-end development using C# language, i plan on working as a developer full time as soon as i finish my studies.
I started my programming from JavaScript. Made all sorts of small projects to learn most of the functions, method implementation and so on. 
I currently only use JS to help me with front end problems that I run into while using Razor (sadly it has a lot of limitation, not being a one page webpage)
You can check out these ASP.NET Razor projects to see what I know how to do and what i have learnt:
- https://github.com/JonasNev/Company-API- (still working on it) - a project that uses RESTful api architecture to create a company database. CRUDE fully working, a little bit more functionality. Project uses Controller -> Service -> Repository principle -> Database interaction
- https://github.com/JonasNev/IgnitisTask - a project created as an entry task solution for a certain company. Main functionality was supposed to be -
"Allow users to add question to DB, load them using DB, assign answers to questions. Questions should have a selection of the possible answers as a dropdown list.
- https://github.com/JonasNev/EFCoreBrokers - a project where I used EntityFramework Core (EF Core) to develop a basic CRUDE functionality. The project also has
basic structure points as Dtos, services to keep it neat.
- https://github.com/JonasNev/NTBrokers - same project concept as in "EFCoreBrokers" just created using hand-written SQL queries. Made it so that i acts dinamically.
Mostly made to show that I understand SQL and can write it by hand if need be.
Edit functionality would be only allowed if the used pressed the 'edit' button. Nothing fancy but does its job.
- https://github.com/JonasNev/Tiktak - a tiktak game made using JS. The game works but "computer" would need to be made smarted. Right now it's completely random, thus
winning is easy.

- GOING TO ADD RESTful API projects soonTM

There are a lot more projects but they are not relevant. 

Projects are sorted by date and is descending.
